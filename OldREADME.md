# Polymerge

Let us introduce Polymerge, our free and open source based project designed to deal with files types.
At start, we directly thought of creating a merging tool using PoC || GTFO from https://kyleisom.net/pocorgtfo/

We couldn't figure out how to do it properly so we will start with basic file handling and data manipulation in order
to start with a test driven project and see how far we can go.

Our objectives may change but here are our main goals :
 * Identify type of files passed in parameter to the program (will be a Python script)
 * Do a quick analysis of Ange Albertini insights to see what is possible to do
 * Hide a file in another. We came up with the idea to hide a PGP Key inside some other file in order to give our project a utility purpose

## Requirements :

 * Additional packages that will need to be imported would be listed here if any is used

## Credits :

We would like to thank Ange Albertini for his work on polyglot and funky format files !
